# Mechanistic-Interpretability-Demo: Visualizing Neuron Features

##  Technical AI Safety Focus: Mechanistic Interpretability

This project delves into **Mechanistic Interpretability**, a critical field in AI safety focused on understanding *how* neural networks internally represent information and make decisions, rather than just observing their input-output behavior. By reverse-engineering internal components, we can identify learned features, detect undesirable internal states, or verify alignment.

**Problem Addressed:** Understanding what specific neurons "detect" helps to debug unexpected model behaviors, verify that a model isn't learning spurious correlations, and is a foundational step toward more robust and aligned AI systems.

##  Technical Implementation

* **Method:** Gradient-based Feature Visualization (also known as "neuron activation maximization"). This technique iteratively modifies a blank input image to maximally activate a specific target neuron in a hidden layer.
* **Target:** A neuron in the first convolutional layer (`model.conv1`), specifically channel 5 at location (2,2), of a simple CNN.
* **Tools:** PyTorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib.
* **Model:** A small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) quickly trained on the MNIST dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results: Visualized Neuron Feature

The image below is the result of optimizing an input image to maximally activate the chosen neuron over 400 iterations.


**Observation and Interpretability Insight:**

1.  **Feature Identity:** The neuron in the `Conv2d` layer (channel 5) is maximally activated by a visual pattern resembling a **sharp, internal corner** or a **small enclosed square**.
2.  **Mechanistic Proof:** This successful visualization proves the technical capability to **reverse-engineer model components**. By forcing the network to reveal its internal learned structure, we gain confidence in debugging and verifying model safetyâ€”a foundation for detecting malicious or deceptive internal features in larger AI systems.
3.  **Optimization Trace:** The optimization process successfully stabilized, reaching a maximum activation of **1.5476**, indicating the optimal image for this feature was successfully generated.
